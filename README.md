Live Server
===========

No live servers as of this moment, but you can clone and start it up yourself to run locally.

About
-----

LainchanBBS is an evolution of the 4Chan BBS project. The original project allowed
for users to browse 4chan via telnet and an old school BBS interface.

Installation
------------

The easiest way to setup Lainchan BBS is to install Python 3 and PIP. Run 
`pip install -r requirements.txt` to get all the required libraries and then 
start the server using `python Server.py`.

Configuration
-------------

`config.py` includes all the configuration settings for the server.
